Pawpid: Where Tails Wag and Hearts Connect

Pawpid is a web-based Multi-Shelter Adoption Matching System that connects adopters with stray animals through intelligent, data-driven recommendations. Built to support animal shelters and responsible adopters in the Philippines, the system addresses low adoption rates by enabling more accurate and humane matches.

Key Features

Intelligent Matching: Utilizes Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to generate compatibility scores and recommend pets based on adopter preferences and care capacity.

AI-Generated Pet Visualization: Powered by Stable Diffusion, adopters can visualize their preferred pet traits. These AI-generated images are compared against real shelter animal images using ResNet for feature extraction and FAISS for efficient similarity search.

Multi-Shelter Integration: Consolidates adoptable pets from multiple shelters into a single, accessible platform.

Adoption Optimization: Increases adoption success rates, reduces shelter overcrowding, and minimizes unnecessary euthanasia.

Project Goal

To promote responsible pet adoption and support animal welfare by bridging the gap between stray animals and potential adopters through machine learning, AI-driven visualization, and vector-based similarity search.
